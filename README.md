# eCommerceWebsiteDiscounts

### Setup and execution:  

After cloning the repository on your machine, go to the following directory ```eCommerceWebsiteDiscounts/src/impl``` from the terminal. Compile the BillTest.java file by running the command ```javac BillTest.java```. To run the code, enter ```java BillTest``` or ```java BillTest customerType```, where customerType can be Employee, Affiliate or Regular (not case-sensetive). If you do not enter any customerType, the program will assume that the customer is not from the three types mentioned here. Then, you will be asked to enter a series of figures to compute the discount available to that customer. For a customer type not mentioned here (i.e. you did not enter any customerType argument), the percentage discount is 0.  

More updates will be added to the code and the README accordingly.
